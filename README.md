cyclic_actions
==============

This small program computes (a superset of) all possible faithful
actions of a cyclic group on a smooth algebraic curve (Riemann
surface) of genus g, given the information on a part of the
ramification.

In other words, the program computes all possible cyclic subgroups of
Aut(F) for some curve F of genus g. The actual possibilities may be
fewer than the ones computed, because the program implements some
necessary conditions that are not sufficient.

See [1] for a presentation of the program with some properties.
